1. Rotating M33 to get edge on frame of reference
	 use code from in class lab
2. Finding snapshots to use
	use extra credit from orbit homework to find peri and apocenters
3. Looking at 1D density profiles from simulation
	adapt density profile in class?
	or use start at the mass distribution homeowrk and plot over radius shells?
	at break in the profile is the tidal radius
4. Compare to analytic solution for tidal radius
   	Use equation from (van den Bosch 2018)
	r(tidal) = R*(m/2M)**(1/3)
	1st-using point masses for galaxies
	2nd-using hernquist profile--once merging use mass of both galaxies
		  for finding a calculate lots of profiles and find the X^2 value for each fit and then at each snapshot use the profile with the smallest X^2 value
5. Plot the rotation curve at the snapshopts within the tidal radius
     using homework problem but changing index to within raius
